TalentScout Hiring Assistant is an interactive, chat-based application built with Streamlit. It leverages Langchain's OllamaLLM to generate dynamic technical interview questions based on a candidate's provided tech stack. This tool streamlines candidate screening by guiding candidates through an engaging conversation where they share their details and answer assessment questions.

## Overview
TalentScout Hiring Assistant helps hiring teams quickly evaluate candidates by:
- Collecting essential candidate information (name, email, years of experience).
- Accepting a list of familiar technologies from the candidate.
- Generating three technical interview questions based on the candidate's tech stack using an LLM.
- Recording candidate responses in a structured format.

This repository contains a single main file, `app.py`, which manages session state, the conversation flow, and LLM integrations.

## Features
- **Conversational UI:** Utilizes Streamlitâ€™s chat interface for a natural dialogue experience.
- **Dynamic Question Generation:** Generates tailored technical questions using the `OllamaLLM` model.
- **State Management:** Uses Streamlit's session state to track candidate progress.
- **Customizable Prompts:** The prompt template for generating questions is easily adjustable.

## How It Works
1. **Greeting & Information Collection:**  
   The assistant starts by greeting the candidate and requesting basic details (full name, email, years of experience).

2. **Tech Stack Input:**  
   The candidate is prompted to provide their familiar technologies as a comma-separated list.

3. **Question Generation:**  
   Using the provided tech stack, the application invokes the LLM to generate three technical interview questions.

4. **Assessment:**  
   The candidate answers each generated question sequentially.

5. **Completion:**  
   Once all questions are answered, the application displays a confirmation message and logs the final candidate data.
